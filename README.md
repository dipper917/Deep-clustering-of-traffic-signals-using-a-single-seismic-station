# Deep-clustering-of-traffic-signals-using-a-single-seismic-station
We present an unsupervised deep clustering framework based on Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC) to identify traffic-induced signal segments from high-frequency seismic noise recorded by a single seismic station. This method enables cost-effective event extraction from ambient noise without labeled data or dense sensors, offering a alternative for urban traffic monitoring, particularly in areas with limited data or few monitoring devices.

The code provided here demonstrates the model training using data from Site 1, part of our study on analyzing traffic-induced seismic signals at urban scales.
